# Two Entity Discrimination with FastAI

![Data Example](https://github.com/dclipca/dclipca.github.io/raw/master/images/entity-discrimination-data-example.png)

First, we need to download the images. In this example we will discriminate between two kinds of mushrooms â€“ Fly Agaric (poisonous) and Champignon (edible). A Bing Image Search key is needed (free). In order to set the key run this in your terminal: `export AZURE_SEARCH_KEY=your_key_here`.
