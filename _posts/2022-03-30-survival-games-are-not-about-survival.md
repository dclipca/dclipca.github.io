# Survival Games Are Not About Survival

One of the best "survival" games I've played was `DayZ Mod`. `DayZ Mod` pionered the `survival` genre and served as a branching point for games such as `Rust`, `Fortnite` and `PUBG`. `DayZ Mod` took the industry by storm, partly because no one was accustomed the freedom it provided. One thing that frustrated me about `DayZ Mod` and other survival games was the missatribution of the game objective ━ the marketed point of the game was to survive but that's not why people were playing it.

Take `Rust` for example. `Rust` Steam description is the following: `The only aim in Rust is to survive. Everything wants you to die - the island’s wildlife and other inhabitants, the environment, other survivors. Do whatever it takes to last another night.` To anyone with more than 10 hours in `Rust`, this would sound absurd. No one plays `Rust` to survive. Surviving is boring and simply put Rust players are not rewarded for surviving. If you would simply want to survive in Rust, you would gather food, build a hidden base and never get outside except for getting more food. That's not what `Rust` players are doing. The typical objective for a `Rust` player is to raid someone's base without getting your base raided ━ this along with all funny emergent events arising in the world.

Similar to `Rust`, `DayZ Mod` core mechanic was survival, but that's not why it worked. The reason it worked so well was because it was a story generator disguised under the mechanic of survival (you have to get food/resources which inevitably leads to an encounted with other players) and sandbox (the encounters with other players are highly emergent because they are free to do whatever they want). The only reason you would play `DayZ Mod` is to find other players, such as in Rust.

There's a clear pattern you can see in any survival game such as `Rust`or `DayZ Mod`, and it's that `survival games are not about survival`. If it's not about survival then what are they about? The answer is `stories`.

The definition of a `story` is a succesion of `events`. An `event` is anything emotionally valuable (someone dies or you find some berries next to a tree) ━ both `events` provoke an emotion. `Stories` is why we watch movies or read books. Since 2010s, we got new ways to generate procedural stories (and even participate in them) in the form of sandbox games. Combine emergent `stories` with the freedom of choosing whatever you want to do, and you get the real reason why "survival" games work.
