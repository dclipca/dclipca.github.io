# Survival Games Are Not About Survival

One of the best "survival" games I've played was `DayZ Mod`. `DayZ Mod` pionered the `survival` genre and served as a branching point for games such as `Rust`, `Fortnite` and `PUBG`. `DayZ Mod` took the industry by storm, partly because no one was accustomed the freedom it provided. One thing that frustrated me about `DayZ Mod` and other survival game players was the missatribution of the game objective ━ the marketed point of the game was to survive but that's not why people were playing it.

Take Rust for example. `Rust` Steam description is the following: `The only aim in Rust is to survive. Everything wants you to die - the island’s wildlife and other inhabitants, the environment, other survivors. Do whatever it takes to last another night.` To anyone with more than 10 hours in `Rust`, this would sound absurd. No one plays Rust to survive. Surviving is boring. If you would simply want to survive in Rust, you would simply gather food, build a hidden base and never get outside except for getting more food. That's not what `Rust` players are doing. The typical objective for a Rust player is to raid someone's base without getting your base raided ━ this along with all funny emergent events arising in the world.

Similar to Rust, `DayZ Mod` core mechanic was survival, but that's not why it worked. The reason it worked so well was because it was a story generator disguised under the mechanic of survival (you have to get food/resources which inevitably leads to an encounted with other players) and sandbox (the encounters with other players are highly emergent because they are free to do whatever they want). The only reason you would play `DayZ Mod` is to find other players, such as in Rust.

There's a clear pattern you can see, and it's that `survival games are not about survival`.
